        <h1 class="text-center">How It All Started </h1>
        <br>
     <p> In 2018 founders of Total Groomin, Jack, Mervin, Sherice, and Celema were HEART trainees who were given an entrepreneurial assignment to create a business. 
         They were all cosmetology students, with Jack specializing in barbering, Mervin did barbering along with lady’s hair, Sherice did hair and nails, while Celema was a masseuse. 
         The project they worked on was a success and they were encouraged by the teacher to pursue because of their talent and the synergy they had amongst them.

      <br><br> After leaving school Sherice was the only you had gotten a job working that a call center, 
          while Mervin, Jack and Celema used their talent as do side hustles. 
         Jack had a reputation and was well known for what he could do and was doing well with cleints. 
         One Saturday however his verandah was packed with persons and he alone couldn’t have attended to everyone, so decided to call his friends. 
         Sherice didn’t attend work that Saturday because Jack begged her for her assistance. 
         That Saturday went well and all persons left smiling, pleased with their new look. 
         Word got around about them and more persons started pouring in, to the point were now had to leave her call center job.

         <br><br>
         Few months had passed and the friends decided to take things 
         seriously and taken on their school project as a full job. In 2020 Total grooming was official, operating out of an abandon
          shop that was in Sherice’s district. They were respected by everyone in the district because it was just a business, 
          but also place were kids who interested to learn were welcomed.
